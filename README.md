# sound-visualisation-generator
A desktop tool that analyses an audio file and produces an audio-reactive Perlin noise video, with live controls for mapping bass/mids/highs to visual parameters

## Overview

This project aims to create a simple application that takes an audio WAV file and generates a Perlin noise–based video that reacts to the sound. Users can adjust settings that influence how audio features (bass, mids, highs) are mapped to visual parameters such as scale, speed, colour, and detail.

While there are existing open-source audio visualisers available online, many are complex to set up, feature-heavy, and have a steep learning curve. Our goal is to keep the UI lightweight and easy to use, with a small set of clear controls focused on producing good-looking results quickly.

The output of the application is an MP4 video containing the generated Perlin noise visualisation.

## Target Users

This project is aimed at content creators, musicians, and anyone interested in generating visuals that react to audio.
